API Example
===========

This example API deploy should get you started with pyinfra's API mode. If you are not familiar with CLI based deploys already, I advise you at least scan through the :doc:`building a deploy guide <../building_a_deploy>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/api_deploy.py
   :language: python

All the files/templates can be found in `the GitHub example <https://github.com/Fizzadar/pyinfra/tree/develop/example>`_. Also see :doc:`the API reference <./reference>`.
